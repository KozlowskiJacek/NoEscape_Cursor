# NoEscape Cursor  

**NoEscape Cursor** is a simple program that locks the edges of your primary monitor whenever a selected game or application is active. This prevents your mouse cursor from escaping to another screen during gameplay.  

Example: while playing *Heroes III*, you can freely move the map without the cursor jumping to the second monitor.  

- âœ… Works only when the selected process is active  
- âœ… Supports *Alt+Tab* (you wonâ€™t get locked out of your PC)  
- âœ… Unlocks automatically when the process is minimized  
- âœ… Closing the GUI stops the script  
- âœ… Does not autostart with Windows

## Origin / History  

The idea for **NoEscape Cursor** came when I wanted to play *Heroes III* and had a problem â€“ the mouse cursor would escape to the second monitor while moving the map. Existing solutions seemed too complicated and time-consuming in the settings, and they blocked the entire screen regardless of whether the game was active or not.  

I decided to create my own script using **AHK (AutoHotKey)**, which locks the monitor edges **only when the selected process is active**. I thought this could help other gamers (or not only gamers ðŸ˜‰), so I made a **simple Python GUI**, which allows you to:  

- enter the process name,  
- save the setting,  
- remove it if you made a mistake.  

I hope this program will help someone and make gaming without a runaway cursor easier!

## How to Use  

1. **Launch the game** or program where you want to lock the cursor  
2. Open `NoEscapeCursor.exe`  
3. In the program window, enter the **process name**, not the game title  

### ðŸ”´ Important: what does "process name" mean?  
- **Do not enter** the game title, e.g., *Might and Magic Heroes III*  
- **Enter** the process name, e.g., `HOMM3 2.0.exe`  

### How to find the process name of your game:  

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open **Task Manager**  
2. Click the **Details** tab

3. Find your running game (e.g., Heroes III)  
4. In the **Name** column, you will see something like `HOMM3 2.0.exe`

5. Copy this name and enter it in the program

## Enabling Cursor Lock  

1. Enter the process name in the GUI

3. The lock now works **only when the game is active**
4. If you minimize the game â€“ the lock disappears

## Disabling  

- To stop the program, just close the GUI (`X` in the top-right corner)  
- After closing, the program does not run in the background  
- After restarting the computer, the program **does not start automatically**
- **Warning** The program runs in the background and shows a H icon in the system tray. If it doesnâ€™t automatically stop when the GUI is closed, donâ€™t worry â€“ it wonâ€™t affect anything and will disappear after a computer restart. You can also right-click the icon and select Exit to close it manually.
